###how .hat works (2.5.x)
- if you trigger .hat within less than [probably three hours] of previously triggering it, you will receive one hat per 5 minutes waited
- if you wait the whole timeout, you will get 50 hats as a reward for your patience, instead of the naive maximum (36)
- if you just want to see how close you are to getting 50 hats, use `.hat check`
- if it is your first time using .hat, you will get the maximum
